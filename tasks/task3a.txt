I've organized my code into distinct layers, separating the UI, logic, and service layers. This layered architecture not only provides a clear structure but also makes it easier to modify specific parts without affecting others.
I adopted the use of descriptive naming conventions for files, classes, variables, and methods.
I incorporated comments where necessary to explain complex logic and provide context.
I applied a modular approach, breaking down the code into smaller components with clear responsibilities.
