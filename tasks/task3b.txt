To ensure the scalability of my design, I've used a responsive approach by heavily adopting media queries. By using media queries, I can dynamically adjust the layout and styles based on different screen sizes, ensuring that my UI remains visually appealing and functional across various devices.
Additionally, I've leveraged libraries (like the flutter_screenutil) to facilitate responsive design, helping me handle screen and font size adaptations more efficiently. These libraries provide convenient tools to address the challenges of diverse screen dimensions and user preferences.
